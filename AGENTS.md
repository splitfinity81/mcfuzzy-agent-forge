# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository (MyForge).

## Repository layout

- `templates/skills/` — the forge skills. Each is a small TypeScript/Node package
  (own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `scripts/`) that gets bootstrapped into
  target repos. Notable ones: `forge-workflow-engine` (autonomous execution),
  `forge-execution-adapter` (manifest compiler), `forge-workforce-compiler`
  (FlowForge kernel packaging). `templates/agents/` holds forge agent personas.
- `scripts/` — the `forge-launcher` npm package (`scripts/forge-launcher/`) plus
  thin bash/PowerShell wrapper scripts that delegate to it.
- `docs/` — human documentation: `updates.md` (the versioned changelog),
  `adr/` (architecture decision records), deep-dive guides, `research/`, and
  generated artifacts (`EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json`, `PROGRESS.md`, …) that the
  skills write into target repos — not source-controlled hand-edits here.
- `plan.md`, `README.md` — project overview and usage. The README opens with a
  `**Latest: v3.x**` line that tracks the top section of `docs/updates.md`.

## Conventions

- **Changelog:** every user-visible change adds a new
  `## <Month> <Year> - v<ver>` section at the top of `docs/updates.md` and bumps
  the README's `**Latest:**` line. Notable features also get an ADR under
  `docs/adr/NNN-*.md` (increment the number; ADR-042 is the latest).
- **Doc-as-you-build:** `SKILL.md`, deep-dives, and the README are updated in the
  same change as the code they describe — docs and changelog are part of the
  feature, not a follow-up.
- **Commit style:** short `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:` prefixes,
  imperative mood, matching the existing history. Only commit/push when asked.
- **Never commit `node_modules/` or `dist/`** — they are gitignored in every
  package and excluded from bootstrap copies. In target repos, `forge-launcher
  bootstrap` installs the deps of each copied skill that declares them (pass
  `--no-install` to skip). Install failures are warnings, not errors: bootstrap
  prints the per-skill `npm install` commands to run by hand.

## Build & verify

Each skill package and the launcher has its own scripts (run from that package's
directory):

```bash
npm install          # first time; installs deps locally (never committed)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm test             # node --test suite
```

Package test globs: the workflow engine runs
`scripts/*.test.ts scripts/*/*.test.ts`; the execution adapter, workforce
compiler, and launcher run `scripts/*.test.ts`. Each package also exposes its
own entry script (e.g. `npm run workflow-engine -- run`).

Linting is repo-wide rather than per-package, and runs from the repository root:

```bash
npm install          # first time; installs Biome only
npm run lint         # biome lint .
npm run lint:fix     # safe autofixes only - never pass --unsafe (see ADR-042)
```

## Tools

- CodeGraph indexes this repo (`.codegraph/`). Prefer `codegraph_explore` before
  grepping/reading when locating or understanding code.

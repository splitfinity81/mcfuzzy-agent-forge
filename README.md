> MyForge turns an idea into a reviewed PRD, a specialist agent team, and an autonomous build.

**Latest: v3.49** — see [docs/updates.md](docs/updates.md) for release notes.

MyForge is a PRD-first workflow for turning product requirements into working software. It combines structured planning, agent-based implementation, and execution orchestration in one path so a project can move from concept to build without losing the review checkpoints that matter.

## Highlights

- Keeps the PRD as the quality gate before implementation begins.
- Generates a specialist agent team from the PRD instead of relying on a single generic assistant.
- Supports both guided, interactive execution and unattended "dark orchestration" runs.
- Includes a local web console for monitoring and controlling builds.
- Can bootstrap MyForge into an existing Git repository without replacing its application code.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Git
- A compatible agent harness such as GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or opencode

### Option 1: Run from a clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/McFuzzySquirrel/mcfuzzy-agent-forge.git
cd mcfuzzy-agent-forge
./scripts/forge-launcher.sh
```

This is the simplest manual path if you want to use the repository directly.

### Option 2: Install the npm package from source

The npm package is not published yet, but you can install it locally from this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/McFuzzySquirrel/mcfuzzy-agent-forge.git
cd mcfuzzy-agent-forge/scripts/forge-launcher
npm install
npm pack
npm install -g ./forge-launcher-1.0.0-beta.4.tgz
```

Once installed, run:

```bash
forge-launcher
```

The launcher walks you through repo bootstrap, idea capture, PRD drafting, team generation, and build execution. The Console also supports bootstrapping an existing repository and adding Feature PRDs to completed projects.

For the manual prompting flow and the CLI’s expected prompts, see [docs/prompt-playbook.md](docs/prompt-playbook.md). For the latest changes and release notes, see [docs/updates.md](docs/updates.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The canonical launcher runtime lives in [scripts/forge-launcher](scripts/forge-launcher). The shell wrappers are compatibility shims for existing workflows.

## How it works

1. Capture your idea and review the PRD.
2. Generate the agent team and any model plan.
3. Run the build interactively or unattended.

## Main components

- `forge-launcher` - the entry point for onboarding, authoring, and launching builds
- `forge-workflow-engine` - the execution engine for orchestration, checkpoints, replay, and state
- `forge-execution-adapter` and `forge-workforce-compiler` - the adapters and packaging layer that compile manifests and hand off work
- Forge Console - a local web UI for authoring, monitoring, and controlling runs

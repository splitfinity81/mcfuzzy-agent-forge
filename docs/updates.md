# Updates

Detailed release and change notes for MyForge.

## September 2026 - v3.49

### Removed an unfixable advisory by removing the dependency

- `skill-review` reported one moderate advisory against `qs@6.15.3`, reached through `azure-devops-node-api` -> `typed-rest-client`. `npm audit fix` reported a fix was available but changed nothing, and the reason is that the fix does not exist: both advisories name `qs@6.16.0` as the fixed version, and the highest published 6.x release is `6.15.3`. Upgrading the SDK is worse rather than better - `azure-devops-node-api@17` depends on `typed-rest-client@3.1.0`, which pins `qs` to `6.15.3` exactly, replacing a permissive range with a hard pin on the vulnerable version.
- The dependency was never used. An exhaustive search for the package name and its API surface across the whole repository returned exactly one hit: the declaration in `package.json`. `scripts/providers/ado.ts` does talk to Azure DevOps, but over the REST API with the global `fetch` and hand-built authorization headers; it imports nothing from the SDK.
- Removed it. `skill-review` goes from 1 moderate advisory to 0 and from 90 dependencies to 67, with typecheck and tests unchanged at exit 0. ADR-041 records the rule this establishes: when an advisory has no published fix, check whether the dependency is needed at all before reaching for an upgrade.

### Dependency updates, code owners, and a pull request template

- Added `.github/dependabot.yml`. There is no root `package.json`, so each package needs its own entry; updates are grouped per package so a routine bump arrives as one pull request instead of a dozen. `forge-build-agent-team` is deliberately absent because it declares no dependencies and ships no lockfile. GitHub Actions versions are tracked on the same weekly schedule.
- Added `.github/CODEOWNERS` and `.github/pull_request_template.md`. The template's checklist encodes the conventions in `AGENTS.md` that `npm run check:version` cannot catch on its own: the changelog entry, the README version bump, the ADR, and the per-package verification commands. ADR-040 recorded the absence of both files as part of the original gap; this closes it.

### Pinned the workflow actions to v7

- `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` moved from v4 to v7, clearing the Node 20 deprecation warnings on all thirteen jobs.
- Three majors of breaking changes were reviewed and none apply. `checkout@v7` blocks fork checkout under `pull_request_target` and `workflow_run`; this workflow uses plain `pull_request`. `setup-node@v5` began enabling caching automatically when `package.json` declares a `packageManager` field, and v6 narrowed that to npm - neither matters here because no manifest declares `packageManager` and there is no root `package.json` at all.
- That last point is a latent trap rather than a current bug, so it is now recorded as a comment in the workflow beside the `setup-node` step: adding a root `package.json` with a `packageManager` field would switch caching on, send the action looking for a root lockfile that does not exist, and fail every leg. The lockfiles live in the six package directories.

## September 2026 - v3.48

### Cross-package typecheck in CI

- The first CI run went red on both `forge-workflow-engine` legs with `error TS2307: Cannot find module 'gray-matter'`, reported against the *adapter's* `discovery.ts`. This is the defect the workflow was added to find, and it is one that no amount of local testing would have surfaced: locally every package is installed, so the dependency is always present.
- `forge-workflow-engine` is the only package in the repository that is not self-contained. `engine.ts` dynamically imports `../../forge-execution-adapter/scripts/discovery.ts`; TypeScript resolves literal-specifier dynamic imports and pulls the target into the compilation, and `discovery.ts` imports `gray-matter`. CI installs dependencies per package, so the adapter's `node_modules` is absent on the engine's leg. The bare specifier resolves from `discovery.ts`'s own directory upward, and the engine's `node_modules` is not on that path - the compile-time twin of the runtime failure fixed in v3.46.
- Fixed in the workflow rather than the source. A `matrix.include` entry gives the engine a `sibling` property, and a step conditional on it runs `npm ci` in the adapter before the typecheck. An `include` entry whose keys match an existing combination merges into it, so the matrix stays at twelve legs and both engine legs pick the property up. Verified by hiding the adapter's `node_modules`: the typecheck exits 2 with the exact CI error, and exits 0 after `npm ci` in the adapter.
- Narrowing the engine's `tsconfig.json` `include` was tested and rejected. With the adapter's `node_modules` hidden, the typecheck fails identically whether or not the adapter's sources are listed. The coupling is in the import graph, not the glob, so the `include` entry stays where it documents the intent. Adding `gray-matter` to the engine's own dependencies cannot work either, for the same resolution reason. ADR-040 records the full set of rejected alternatives, including the shared-types extraction that would sever the coupling properly.

## September 2026 - v3.47

### Continuous integration on Windows and Linux

- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The repository had no `.github/` directory at all: six independently installable packages and 243 tests were verified only by whoever remembered to run them locally, on whichever platform they happened to be on. Every defect fixed in v3.46 would have been caught on the first push by a matrix that runs `npm ci` and `npm test`.
- The `test` job is a 12-leg matrix - 6 packages x `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` - with `fail-fast: false` so one broken leg does not mask the others. Each leg installs, typechecks, and tests one package from its own directory.
- Fixed a latent Linux defect found while writing the workflow, symmetrical to the Windows quoting bug in v3.46. `forge-workflow-engine` used `scripts/**/*.test.ts`; npm runs scripts through `sh` on Linux, where `**` is not special without `globstar`, so the pattern degraded to `scripts/*/*.test.ts` and matched **only the 5 files in subdirectories**. The 6 top-level files, including `engine.test.ts` and `verify.test.ts`, were dropped, and npm still exited 0. The `pretest` guard would not have caught it either: it walks the tree in Node and correctly finds 11 files, so it verifies that tests exist, not that the runner received them. The first green Ubuntu run would have skipped more than half the engine's coverage while reporting success.
- Replaced the recursive glob with explicit per-level patterns, `scripts/*.test.ts scripts/*/*.test.ts`. Under `sh` both expand to 6 + 5 = 11; under `cmd` both pass through literally and Node expands them to 11. Windows is byte-for-byte unchanged at 104 passing, and Linux goes from 5 test files to 11. The trade-off is a hard-coded depth of two, recorded as a known limitation in ADR-040.
- Pinned CI to Node 22. The launcher's declared `engines.node >= 18` is accurate for its runtime and is left alone, but it is not accurate for running the suites on Windows: npm invokes scripts through `cmd.exe`, which does not expand globs, so the patterns reach Node unexpanded and depend on its built-in `--test` glob support from Node 21.
- Steps run under `shell: bash` on both runners. The install step is conditional on a lockfile being present, which needs a POSIX shell; Git Bash ships on GitHub's Windows runners, so one code path covers both. `forge-build-agent-team` is the documented exception - no lockfile because it declares no dependencies, and no `typecheck` script because it is plain `.mjs` - handled with `npm install` as the fallback and `npm run typecheck --if-present`.
- A second job runs `npm run check:version`, enforcing the AGENTS.md rule that the README's `**Latest:**` line tracks the top section of this file. The convention was already relied on and had no enforcement.
- The workflow requests `permissions: contents: read` and uses no secrets, so it runs correctly under the read-only token given to fork pull requests. npm caching is deliberately not enabled: there is no root lockfile, and `cache-dependency-path` cannot be varied per matrix leg.

---

## September 2026 - v3.46

### Portable npm install and self-verifying test discovery

- Removed a self-referential `file:` dependency from `scripts/forge-launcher/package.json` and pruned the matching lockfile entries. The referenced tarball is gitignored and never present in a fresh clone, so `npm install` failed with `ENOENT` before any build could start.
- Unquoted the test glob in `templates/skills/forge-workflow-engine/package.json`. It was the only package of six that single-quoted the pattern; PowerShell passes single quotes through literally, so Node matched no files and reported `tests 0` with exit 0. Eleven test files, including `engine.test.ts`, had never run on Windows. The suite now reports 104 passing.
- Added an `assert-tests-discovered.mjs` `pretest` guard to the workflow engine. `node --test` exits 0 when its pattern matches nothing, so a quoting or path mistake produces a green run with zero coverage; the guard fails the run instead. It walks the tree manually to stay within the package's `node >= 18` floor.
- Moved the engine's dynamic import of the adapter's discovery module inside its existing `try` block in both `runEngine` and `replayTask`, and surfaced the caught reason. Agent discovery was always designed to be optional, but a module-load failure was escaping as an unhandled `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on a public entry point.
- Replaced POSIX-only `true`/`false` shell builtins in four test fixtures with `exit 0`/`exit 1`, matching the convention already used elsewhere in the same suite. Production verification code was already cross-platform; only the fixtures were affected.
- Corrected `SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md`, which described dependency installation as automatic at prep time. No code performed it - the launcher mentioned `npm install` only in hint strings, and the shell wrappers only printed it in error text.

### Bootstrap installs skill dependencies

- `forge-launcher bootstrap` now installs dependencies for every copied skill that declares them, closing the gap the item above documented. It uses `npm ci` where a lockfile exists and `npm install` otherwise. Of the 15 shipped skills, 4 declare dependencies; the rest are prompt-and-markdown only and are skipped without spawning anything.
- Install failures never abort a bootstrap. The reason is logged as a warning and the completion summary prints the exact per-skill `npm install` commands to run by hand. The install body is also wrapped in `try/catch` because `runCommand` rejects on spawn error, so a machine without `npm` on `PATH` degrades instead of throwing.
- Added `--no-install` to opt out and restore the previous offline, filesystem-only behaviour. The flag is plumbed to the CLI only; Console call sites keep install-by-default.
- `npm` is invoked as `npm.cmd` on win32. `runCommand` spawns without `shell: true`, and npm ships on Windows as a `.cmd` shim that bare `spawn` cannot launch - the same hazard `describeSpawnError` already documents.
- Replicated the `assert-tests-discovered.mjs` `pretest` guard into all six packages, with the filename suffix parameterised so `forge-build-agent-team` can match `.test.mjs`. The script is copied rather than shared, because cross-package coupling is what caused the engine's import defect.
- Generated the missing `package-lock.json` for `skill-review` so `npm ci` is valid there. `forge-build-agent-team` is intentionally left without one: it declares no dependencies.
- Fixed the three remaining Windows failures, all test-only. `expandPath` returns the raw expanded string for `$VAR` input on every platform; the console server returns `path.basename`, not a `/`-split; and `discoverForgeRepo` builds `visionPath` with `join`. Production code was already correct in all three cases - only the assertions hard-coded POSIX separators.
- Verified the engine's degraded path rather than assuming it. With the adapter's `gray-matter` renamed away, the dynamic import rejects with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in 0.2s and is caught cleanly.
- **All six packages are green on Windows for the first time: 243 passing, 0 failing, exit 0.**

## September 2026 - v3.45

### Forge Console: synchronize the user guide and Quick help

- Refreshed the in-console user guide to match the current Console workflow, including manual manifest preparation, targeted task selection, dependency expansion, incremental feature work, reconciliation review, task timeouts, concurrency, auto-commit, and background job behavior.
- Corrected the New Project document guidance so existing PRDs are limited to the formats accepted by the PRD picker, while research/seed documents retain their broader format support.
- Expanded the Help dialog's Quick help with the current build controls, incremental-work flow, and updated view descriptions. The User guide tab continues to render the canonical `docs/forge-console-user-guide.md` source.

---

## September 2026 - v3.44

### Reviewable authoring and incremental execution controls

- Authoring lifecycle events are persisted as structured JSON Lines in `docs/AUTHORING-EVENTS.jsonl`. The existing `FORGE_EVENT` records in `docs/engine-run.log` and Console SSE `authoring` stream remain compatible with existing consumers.
- The Console exposes `POST /api/tasks/reset-changed` and a matching Overview control to reset completed or skipped tasks listed in manifest reconciliation's `changedTaskIds` back to pending after review. Task output, timestamps, errors, and artifact references are cleared so the task can execute against its revised contract.
- Added `npm run check:version`, an automated guard that verifies README's Latest version matches the first release heading in `docs/updates.md`, with unit coverage for matching, drift, and missing metadata.

---

## September 2026 - v3.43

### Increment authoring observability and reconciliation guidance

- Launcher feature authoring emits structured `FORGE_EVENT` lifecycle records while preserving ordinary process-log lines.
- Console SSE exposes lifecycle records as `authoring` events alongside the existing `log` stream.
- Overview shows reconciliation counts, changed task IDs, and the next action for new pending feature tasks.
- Added coverage for authoring SSE/plain-log compatibility and reconciliation projection.
- Documented Feature Increment Mode review and recovery actions.

---

## September 2026 - v3.42

### Existing repository bootstrap and incremental project work

- The Forge Console Home and Projects views can bootstrap MyForge into an existing repository with explicit harness, overwrite, and Git initialization controls.
- Existing repositories can author context-aware project PRDs and additive Feature PRDs through `forge-build-feature-prd`, including after a completed build.
- Manifest recompilation preserves task state by stable task ID and adds new feature tasks as pending.
- Bootstrap and authoring output is written to the repository's `docs/engine-run.log` for live Console streaming.
- Linux users may install `xdg-utils` for automatic browser/document opening; manual URL and path fallbacks remain available.
- Feature increment runs are scoped to their newly emitted task IDs, reject missing Feature PRD output, and expose reconciliation details for review.
- `forge-launcher draft-prd` now authors from an existing repository when `docs/IDEA.md` is absent, using source, docs, tests, manifests, and history as context.
- Added `forge-launcher feature-increment --prompt ... [--run]` to author a feature, invoke Feature Increment Mode, reconcile the manifest, and optionally run it.
- Monolithic PRD repositories may add `docs/features/*.md`; those tasks compile additively after existing PRD phases. Reconciliation now reports changed task contracts as well as added and removed IDs.
- Authoring remains a launcher job and its process output is streamed through the existing repository log and Console SSE endpoint. See [ADR-037](adr/037-existing-repository-incremental-authoring.md).

## September 2026 - v3.41

### Forge Console: elapsed time now reflects completed task work

- **Overview no longer shows wall-clock runtime as elapsed.** The elapsed stat is now the combined duration of all completed tasks in the current visible run scope, so it reflects actual finished work instead of how long the dashboard has been open or how long the run has existed.
- **The Forge Board HUD now matches Overview.** Its timer uses the same summed completed-task duration, keeping the board and overview consistent during full and manual/scoped runs.

---

## September 2026 - v3.40

### Forge Console: manual pre-build now stops at manifest creation

- **Overview's pipeline card is simpler.** Before a manifest exists it now shows only a **Manual build** checkbox plus the next pipeline action, instead of exposing task-selection-oriented controls that cannot work yet.
- **Manual pre-build no longer dead-ends.** When that checkbox is enabled at the team → build stage, the pipeline action becomes **Create manifest**. The console compiles `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json` without auto-starting the full workflow, so you can review tasks and make a targeted selection first.
- **Manifest-driven controls stay in the Controls panel.** Once the manifest exists, build mode selection, task-count feedback, **Choose tasks**, and the existing Run/Resume/Pause/Stop actions remain together in **Overview → Controls** where they are actually actionable.

---

## September 2026 - v3.39

### Forge Console: tracked background jobs from project creation through build

- **Detached work is now a first-class console concept.** The console records a shared background-job model for project creation, headless PRD drafting, team generation, engine runs/resumes, and task replay. Each job keeps its repo path, PID, log path, timestamps, status, and the latest status message.
- **Home, Projects, Overview, and New Project now surface live job state.** Instead of a one-shot "started" toast, the browser can now show whether a project is **creating**, **drafting PRD**, **generating team**, **running**, **paused**, **ready**, or **failed**, with status derived from the live PID plus repo/run artifacts rather than brittle log scraping.
- **Project creation is visibly asynchronous.** The New Project wizard now shows a live status card for the background bootstrap job and lets you select the repo once it exists, while the Overview pipeline shows completion/failure banners with a direct path to the Logs view.

### Forge Console + Workflow Engine: manual execution mode for targeted task runs

- **Manual mode is now persisted in `docs/engine-config.json`.** In addition to harness, granularity, concurrency, timeouts, retries, and auto-commit, the engine config now stores an execution mode (`auto` vs `manual`), the selection scope (`single`, `range`, or `list`), and the selected task IDs to use on Run/Resume.
- **Overview and Tasks now support targeted runs.** The Overview **Controls** panel gains an execution-mode toggle and switches its primary action copy between **Run** and **Run selected**. The Tasks view now supports explicit multi-select plus contiguous range selection, shows the selected-task count, and saves that selection back to engine config for later resumes.
- **Scoped execution happens in the engine, not by mutating task state.** Manual runs pass the selected task IDs into `forge-launcher engine-run` / `workflow-engine run`, the engine auto-expands unmet dependencies, and only the scoped slice contributes to ready-frontier selection and progress counts. Unselected tasks remain untouched for future full or manual runs, while paused scoped runs keep their active selection in `docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json`.

---

## September 2026 - v3.38

### Console: concurrency setting in Overview and New Project

- **Concurrency is now configurable from the browser.** The Overview **Controls** panel gains a "Concurrency (parallel agents)" number input with a **Set** button. Enter a positive integer to run that many agents in parallel on the next run/resume; set it to 0 to revert to the engine default. The value is saved to `docs/engine-config.json` and passed as `--concurrency N` when the engine starts, exactly as the CLI `--concurrency` flag works.
- **New Project wizard gains a Concurrency field.** Creating a project from the browser now includes an optional "Concurrency (parallel agents)" number field. When set, it is forwarded to the launcher as `FORGE_ENGINE_CONCURRENCY` so the new repo is pre-configured at creation time.

### Engine: output files now recorded for tasks that only modify existing files

- **Fix.** When an agent edited pre-existing files rather than creating new ones, the engine recorded an empty `outputFiles` list for the completed task. This produced warnings about tasks completing without recorded output files, and meant downstream tasks saw no file context in the artifact `filesChanged` field.
- **Now** the engine takes a worktree snapshot before and after each task (via `git status --porcelain`). Files that transition from clean to dirty during the task are detected by diffing the two snapshots and merged into `outputFiles` before the artifact and run state are saved. Both new files and in-place modifications are captured; files that were already dirty before the task ran are correctly excluded. This requires a git repo; non-git directories fall back to the existing behaviour.

### Engine: richer artifact context projected to downstream agents

- **Problem.** Synthesised artifacts (created automatically when a task completes) had two weaknesses: the summary was grabbed from the first stdout line — often an agent's internal monologue — so downstream agents got unhelpful context; and the projected context block only included `summary` and `confidence`, omitting the `filesChanged` list and the agent output excerpt that were stored in the artifact.
- **Summary now reflects the task itself.** `synthesise()` now sets the artifact summary to `"<task title>: <task description>"` (up to 200 chars), which always describes what the task was supposed to do — not what the agent said it was going to do. The stdout excerpt is still stored in the payload for diagnostics.
- **Confidence defaults to 0.9** for all synthesised completion artifacts (was absent, rendering the field as "N/A" in projections).
- **`filesChanged` and `agentOutputExcerpt` are now projected by default.** The default context field set is expanded from `["summary", "confidence"]` to `["summary", "confidence", "filesChanged", "agentOutputExcerpt"]`. The `filesChanged` list is rendered as a markdown bullet list in the context block; an empty list is suppressed. This means downstream agents automatically receive a list of every file the upstream task touched — including files detected via the new git-diff enrichment above.

---

## October 2026 - v3.37

### Forge Console: user guide refreshed and available in the Help modal

- **The user guide is now in the console.** The Help dialog (top-right **Help** button) gains a **User guide** tab alongside the quick reference. It renders the walkthrough (`docs/forge-console-user-guide.md`, shipped with the package as `guide.md` and served at `/guide.md`), so the full walkthrough is one click away from any view instead of living only in the repo docs.
- **Guide refreshed for v3.37.** Brought `forge-console-user-guide.md` up to date with the current UI: the `--port` flag, the New Project wizard's **Description** and **Visibility** fields, research/seed docs accepting `.md`/`.txt`/`.pdf`/`.docx` (multi-file via picker or comma-separated paths), the Overview **Manifest** panel and Live/Idle + harness header, and the Plan & Team **skills cards grouped into Forge vs Project skills**. Section titles were tightened into a parallel verb-first style and a pointer to the changelog was added.
- **Relative doc links render as text** in the guide tab (they can't resolve inside the served page), while external and fragment links stay clickable.

---

## September 2026 - v3.36

### Engine log no longer duplicates every line on detached runs

- **Fix.** When a run was started detached (from the Forge Console's Run/Resume,
  or the interactive launcher's "run now detached"), the launcher's `runTee`
  wrote the engine output to `docs/engine-run.log` **and** forwarded it to its
  stdout — which the console/detached spawn had already redirected to that same
  log file. Every engine line (phase, context projection, "starting task",
  heartbeats, etc.) was therefore logged twice, sometimes merged mid-line.
- **Now** `runTee` only echoes to stdout/stderr when they are attached to a
  terminal, so a detached run writes each line exactly once. Terminal runs
  (`forge-launcher engine-run` in a shell) still stream live output unchanged.

### Execution adapter: a skills-only harness root no longer shadows the real one

- **Fix.** `discoverForgeRepo`'s harness-root detection matched any root with
  `agents/` **or** `skills/`. A stray skills-only root (e.g. a `.github/` that
  has skills but no agents) could shadow the real harness root, so agent
  discovery returned **zero agents** — the engine then *skipped* every task
  ("No agent matched owner …"), and because skipped counts as done, a resume
  could mark a whole run complete without executing anything.
- **Now** a root that owns `agents/` wins; a skills-only root is only used when
  no root has agents, and a warning records any ignored skills-only root. This
  restores correct owner matching (and real execution) for runs with mixed
  harness roots.

### Forge Board: clearer expanded cards and fixed avatar moods

- **Expanded cards get wider.** Clicking a task card now widens it (+150px) in
  addition to growing taller, so the expanded detail (full title, description,
  status/owner/phase/timeout/inputs/outputs rows) has room to breathe; the
  card floats over its right neighbor on an opaque backdrop.
- **Detail rows no longer overlap.** The key/value rows previously drew the
  label and value at the same spot, so "Status · complete" rendered on top of
  itself. Labels now sit in their own column with the value indented beside
  them, and row spacing was increased.
- **Avatars smile when done.** The face's mouth had the smile/frown arcs
  reversed, so completed cards looked cross and failed ones grinned. Completed
  cards now smile, failed ones frown (running = dot, pending/skipped = neutral).
- **Long task ids are trimmed** to fit the card instead of spilling over the
  edge.

### Engine heartbeat default raised to 60s

- The engine's per-task heartbeat line (`…still working on task <id> (@<agent>, Ns elapsed)`)
  now prints every **60 seconds** by default instead of 15, so `docs/engine-run.log`
  stays quieter during long tasks. Override with `--heartbeat-ms` /
  `FORGE_ENGINE_HEARTBEAT_MS` (or `0` to disable).

### Auto-commit after each completed task (default on)

- **One commit per completed task.** The workflow engine now commits the
  working tree after each task completes, sequenced after the wave merge so it
  is safe at any concurrency level. The commit includes the task's work **and**
  the engine-owned files (`docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json`, `docs/EXECUTION-AUDIT.jsonl`,
  `docs/PROGRESS.md`), producing a clear, attributable history aligned with the
  manifest's task decomposition.
- **Default on** (per product decision). Existing runs change behaviour by
  default. Disable with `--no-auto-commit` (`FORGE_ENGINE_AUTO_COMMIT=0`) —
  for example when mid-rebase or with pre-existing uncommitted changes you
  don't want mixed with agent output.
- **Custom message template.** `--commit-message-template "<tmpl>"` (or
  `FORGE_ENGINE_COMMIT_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE`) with `{taskId}` / `{taskTitle}`
  placeholders; default is `feat(forge-engine): complete task {taskId} - {taskTitle}`.
- **Non-fatal failures.** A repo without `.git`, an empty diff, or a failed
  commit (e.g. no git identity) is logged/skipped and never fails the task or
  the run. A new `task.committed` audit event records the commit SHA.
- **Wired through the CLI and console.** `forge-launcher engine-run` accepts
  `--auto-commit|--no-auto-commit` and `--commit-message-template`; the setting
  persists in `docs/engine-config.json` (new `autoCommit` field) and appears as
  a checkbox on the console **Overview** (Controls panel). The interactive
  launcher's engine configuration also asks about it (default yes).

### Forge Console: add an existing PRD and research/seed documents in the New Project wizard

- **Mirrors the CLI's Step 6.** The New Project wizard now has a **Project
  documents** section (after the idea) where you can add an existing PRD and
  research/seed documents (design specs, market research, technical notes) —
  exactly like the terminal flow. Docs are copied to `docs/PRD.md` and
  `docs/research/`, so the later PRD build (`forge-auto-build-prd`) reads the
  research context and a supplied PRD is used as-is instead of being drafted.
- **Browse by file picker or absolute path.** Both fields support a file-picker
  browse (upload) **and** a typed absolute path (comma-separated for multiple
  research docs). Picked files are staged server-side (`POST /api/uploads`) and
  the launcher is handed the paths via `FORGE_PRD_FILE` / `FORGE_RESEARCH_FILES`.
- **Research docs are visible afterwards.** The console's Plan & Team view now
  lists `docs/research/*.md` entries (kind `research`), so the docs you added
  are browsable in the browser.

### Forge Console: launch the harness CLI from a task

- **"Launch <harness> CLI"** button on the **Tasks** view header and the
  **Overview** header opens the project's harness CLI (opencode / copilot /
  claude, chosen from the repo's harness root) in a new terminal window in the
  project folder — so you can watch the live run and take over at any point.
  Backed by `POST /api/launch-cli` (injectable in tests); when no desktop
  terminal emulator is found the UI shows the exact command to run manually.

## August 2026 - v3.35

### Forge Console: skills shown as cards, grouped Forge vs Project

- **Skills render as cards in Plan & Team.** The Skills section of the console's
  Plan & Team view previously listed skills as a plain bulleted list. They now
  use the same card layout as the agent team, with the skill name, a category
  badge, description, its location under the harness, and an **Open** button
  (opens the skill directory in your file manager).
- **Skills are grouped into Forge skills and Project skills.** Skills
  bootstrapped from the forge templates (the `forge-*` skills plus
  `skill-creator`/`skill-review`/`skill-review-updater`) are classified as
  **Forge skills**; skills the generated team wrote for the project are grouped
  under **Project skills**. Each group renders its own card grid with a count
  in its heading, and empty groups are omitted.
- **Classification is derived, not stored.** The console matches a skill's
  directory against the forge template set it bootstraps from, so the grouping
  stays in sync as forge skills are added or renamed, and no re-bootstrap of
  existing projects is required.

---

## August 2026 - v3.34

### Agent/skill descriptions: single-line, double-quoted frontmatter

- **No more block scalars.** Generated agents and skills sometimes used a YAML
  folded/literal block scalar (`description: >` / `|`), which harnesses with
  simple frontmatter readers render as just `>` — the agent/skill looked
  undecorated (e.g. the Forge Console's Plan & Team view). Descriptions must
  now be **single-line and double-quoted** (`description: "..."`).
- **The `validate-frontmatter.mjs` gate now rejects them.** It flags block
  scalars (`>`/`|` and their `-`/`+` variants), multi-line values, unquoted
  descriptions, and the existing unquoted `: ` / `#` hazards — so
  `forge-build-agent-team` fails the gate instead of shipping broken files.
- **Templates and instructions updated.** `forge-build-agent-team` and
  `skill-creator` callouts/checklists/templates now mandate the single-line
  double-quoted form; the bootstrapped agent/skill template files were swept to
  match, so fresh teams pass the gate cleanly.
- **Parsers now tolerate block scalars anyway.** The Forge Console
  (`forge-launcher`) and the workforce compiler read folded/literal
  descriptions correctly, so pre-existing or third-party files written with
  `>`/`|` still display properly.

---

## August 2026 - v3.33

### Forge Console: restore Copilot harness for pre-existing GitHub repos

- The console **Run** action now infers the engine harness from the repo's
  harness root when `docs/engine-config.json` is absent, so projects bootstrapped
  before engine-config persistence existed run with `copilot` again instead of
  silently defaulting to `opencode`. New projects (bootstrapped via the launcher
  or console) are unaffected: their harness is already persisted during
  bootstrap.
- Setting the engine-wide default timeout (`set all` / Controls) on a repo
  without a config now writes the inferred harness too, instead of pinning
  `opencode`.
- The engine execution harness for Claude and generic `.agents` repos remains
  `opencode` — the workflow engine currently ships opencode, Copilot, OpenAI,
  stub, and FlowForge kernel adapters only.

## August 2026 - v3.32

### Forge Console: edit task timeouts

- **Per-task timeout editor.** Each task's detail drawer in the **Tasks** view
  now lets you set that task's `timeoutMs` override (a number input + Apply),
  and the Overview **Controls** panel has a matching task picker + Set control.
  This is the "bump the timeout on a failed task, then Replay it" flow: builds
  and tests that exceed the default can be given a larger budget and retried.
- **Set every task's timeout at once.** The Tasks view header and the Overview
  Controls panel both offer a "set all" control that writes `timeoutMs` to every
  manifest task *and* updates the engine-wide default in
  `docs/engine-config.json`, so the whole run gets a longer budget in one step.
- **How it's stored.** Per-task values are written back to
  `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json` (`ManifestTask.timeoutMs`); the "all tasks"
  action also writes `taskTimeoutMs` into `docs/engine-config.json`. Edits are
  preserved by `replay` and by `run`/`resume` unless a granularity is explicitly
  set (which recompiles the manifest from the PRD, regenerating `timeoutMs`).
- New token-gated `POST /api/tasks/timeout` endpoint (`{ taskId?, timeoutMs }`)
  validates the value and broadcasts a snapshot refresh.
- **Enter timeouts in minutes.** The timeout inputs (Tasks detail, "Set all",
  and Overview Controls) accept minutes with decimals (`1.5` = 90s) and convert
  to/from the millisecond values stored in the manifest and `engine-config.json`.
- **Finished tasks are read-only.** Completed/skipped tasks show their timeout
  as plain text instead of an editor - the task's own `timeoutMs`, or the
  effective default (`default · 10 min`) when it never had an override. Failed,
  pending, and running tasks stay editable so a failed task can be bumped and
  replayed.

### Forge Console: Manifest panel links to Plan & Team

- The Overview **Manifest** panel now shows a single **Open Plan & Team** link
  (replacing the IDEA/PRD-only links) - the Plan & Team view lists every
  document (IDEA, PRD, vision, features, progress, model plan) plus the agent
  team and skills.
- Added a practical [Forge Console user guide](forge-console-user-guide.md) for
  launching the console, creating or opening projects, switching repos, and
  monitoring runs from the browser.

## August 2026 - v3.31

### Forge Console: a local web UI over the launcher and workflow engine

- **`forge-launcher console`** opens a self-contained web UI that fronts both
  `forge-launcher` (authoring) and `forge-launcher engine-run` →
  `workflow-engine` (build) from one browser app. It is TypeScript compiled with
  `tsc`, served on `127.0.0.1` (default port `4300`, next free port if busy).
- **Project picker** landing page lists your projects and lets you add an
  existing repo.
- **New Project wizard** creates a repo by spawning
  `forge-launcher --non-interactive` with `FORGE_REPO_NAME` / `_PARENT_DIR` /
  `_DESCRIPTION` / `_VISIBILITY` / `_HARNESS_CHOICE` / `_IDEA` (plus optional
  `FORGE_AUTO_DRAFT=1`).
- **Resume a setup** - draft the PRD (`forge-launcher --draft`), generate the
  team (headless `forge-build-agent-team`), or start the build.
- **Start / resume a build** - `forge-launcher engine-run --harness <h> --yes`,
  detached, logged to `docs/engine-run.log`.
- **Views** - Overview (run header, progress, counts, blockers), **Board** (the
  existing PixiJS Forge Board embedded full-screen at `/board`), Tasks
  (filterable/sortable table + detail), Logs (`engine-run.log` tail + audit
  stream), Documents (read-only IDEA/PRD/vision/features/progress/model-plan +
  agent team, "open externally"), Artifacts (browse by type/task + preview), and
  Timeline (audit events, failure-highlighted).
- **Run controls** - Pause / Stop (write `docs/engine-control.json` + SIGTERM
  `docs/engine.pid`), Replay a failed task (`workflow-engine replay <task>`), and
  Run / Resume.

### Project registry

- Projects are remembered in a registry at `~/.myforge/projects.json` (honoring
  `FORGE_HOME` / `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`).

### TypeScript client + loopback security

- The console client is plain TypeScript compiled with `tsc` (no bundler),
  served loopback-only, and state-changing POST endpoints require an
  `X-Forge-Token` header (a per-server random token embedded in the served HTML)
  to block cross-origin drive-by requests; file reads are path-traversal
  guarded.

### `forge-launcher engine-run` tees engine output to a log

- `forge-launcher engine-run` tees engine output to `docs/engine-run.log`, so a
  detached run is tail-able from the terminal and the console alike.

- See [ADR-034](adr/034-forge-console-web-ui.md).

## August 2026 - v3.30

### Branding: "Agent Forge" is now "MyForge"

- Rebranded the project from **McFuzzy Agent Forge** to **MyForge** across the
  README, `docs/`, `plan.md`, `AGENTS.md`, agent templates, and skill templates.
- Technical identifiers are unchanged: the `forge-*` package/CLI/skill names
  (`forge-launcher`, `forge-workflow-engine`, `forge-execution-adapter`,
  `forge-workforce-compiler`), `FORGE_*` environment variables, and the
  **FlowForge** kernel name all keep their existing names.
- The workforce compiler's default package ID root changed from
  `dev.agent-forge.*` to `dev.myforge.*` (for example
  `dev.myforge.my-project`), so freshly compiled workforce packages use the new
  branding. See `docs/adr/033-brand-rename-to-myforge.md`.

---

## August 2026 - v3.29

### Research/docs: Forge Console feature plan

- Added `docs/research/forge-console-desktop-frontend-plan.md`, a proposed plan
  for introducing a desktop/web front end for `forge-launcher` and
  `forge-workflow-engine`.
- The plan compares desktop-first vs. web-first approaches and recommends
  evolving the existing local Forge Board dashboard into a broader **Forge
  Console** first, then evaluating desktop packaging later.
- The phased roadmap covers MVP observability (status/tasks/logs/output), run
  controls (pause/stop/replay), artifact/history views, and optional desktop
  wrapping after adoption is validated.

---

## August 2026 - v3.28

### Workflow engine: same-owner task serialization under parallelism

- **Same-owner tasks never run concurrently.** With `--concurrency > 1`, the
  engine previously dispatched the whole ready frontier in parallel - including
  tasks owned by the same agent, which share a subsystem (project dir, build
  outputs, ports) and can collide even when the dependency graph sees them as
  independent (e.g. a port-`Address already in use` clash between an Edge
  scaffold task and an Edge build task).
- The wave dispatcher now keeps **at most one task per owning agent** per wave
  (`ownerUniqueReady`); same-owner tasks drain one per wave while cross-owner
  tasks still parallelize up to `--concurrency`. Sequential runs (`--concurrency
  1`) are unchanged. Unassigned tasks are bucketed together conservatively.
- This is a dispatch-layer guard; the manifest dependency graph and the
  responsibility matrix are untouched. Cross-owner tasks on shared paths (one
  task scaffolding a directory while another builds inside it) remain the
  operator's responsibility - a future file-overlap gate would close that.
- New tests: `ownerUniqueReady` (per-owner first-wins, unassigned bucketing,
  empty), same-owner serialization under concurrency 2, and different-owner
  concurrency under concurrency 2. See ADR-021 (amended).

### Execution-adapter: framework names no longer mistaken for expected outputs

- **`extractPaths` no longer treats framework/runtime names as file paths.**
  A PRD bullet like "Build **ASP.NET** Core minimal API …" previously declared
  `ASP.NET` as an expected output file, which can never exist on disk - so the
  engine's output-verification gate failed the task on **every** attempt (and
  each retry spawned a fresh identically-titled opencode session, looking like a
  collision). A `NON_PATH_DOTTED_TOKENS` blocklist (`asp.net`, `.net`, `dotnet`,
  `nuget`) now excludes these; real paths such as `src/HumanGateway.Core` are
  still extracted.
- Regression test added; recompiling a manifest drops the bogus `ASP.NET`
  expected output, so affected tasks pass the output gate on the next
  `replay`/`run`.

---

## August 2026 - v3.27

### Engine pause & stop (graceful), launcher config persistence

- **`workflow-engine stop`** (and a fixed `pause`) now actually stop a running
  detached engine. The engine polls `docs/engine-control.json` at the top of
  each task wave and writes its PID to `docs/engine.pid` at startup. `stop`
  writes a stop request **and** SIGTERMs the PID; Ctrl+C / SIGTERM on the engine
  process triggers the same graceful stop via an in-process flag. Either way the
  in-flight task finishes, state is saved as `paused`, and `run` resumes from the
  last completed task. Previously `pause` only flipped the state file and the
  loop never re-read it, so a live run could not be stopped.
- **`forge-launcher engine-run --stop` / `--pause`** request the same graceful
  stop/pause from the launcher (no manifest or recompile needed) - the terminal
  counterpart to `workflow-engine stop`.
- **`forge-launcher resume`** offers **"Stop the engine after the current task"**
  when it detects a live run, and its resume/monitor commands now reuse the last
  configured engine options instead of the minimal `--harness`-only command.
- **Engine options persist**: the launcher writes the menu choices
  (harness, granularity, concurrency, timeout, retries, viz, keep-alive, attach)
  to `docs/engine-config.json`; resume loads them (explicit env vars still win).
- New tests: control-file round-trip, stop-before-any-task, stop-mid-run after
  the current task, the SIGINT/SIGTERM flag path, launcher `--stop`/`--pause`
  delegation, resume carrying persisted config, and env-overrides-persisted.
  See ADR-032.

---

## August 2026 - v3.26

### Workflow engine: adaptive keep-alive default + timeout/retry surfacing

- **Keep-alive is now the adaptive default.** The opencode harness boots a warm
  `opencode serve` and attaches every task to it when **more than one task
  remains**, and cold-starts per task when ≤1 remains (short resumes don't pay a
  server boot). This replaces the previous all-cold-start default for multi-task
  dark runs (see ADR-027 for the keep-alive mechanics).
- **New escape hatches.** `--no-keep-alive` (or `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH=0`) forces
  cold start per task; `--keep-alive` / `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH=1` still force
  keep-alive; `--attach <url>` / `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH_URL` still reuse an
  existing server. Precedence: attach → no-keep-alive → keep-alive → adaptive.
- **Pre-run summary** now shows max retries, retry delay, concurrency, and the
  keep-alive mode (not just the per-task timeout).
- **Agents learn their execution budget.** `HarnessAdapter.invoke` now receives
  `maxRetries`, and the opencode/copilot adapters render an **Execution budget**
  hint (per-task timeout in seconds + retry count + "don't rely on retries to fix
  hollow output") in the task prompt.
- `forge-launcher engine-run` forwards `--no-keep-alive` (flag and
  `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH=0`).
- New tests: `shouldKeepAlive` precedence table, `remainingTaskCount` (fresh /
  complete / skipped / leftover-running), engine→harness `maxRetries` threading,
  and budget-hint rendering. See ADR-031.

---

## August 2026 - v3.25

### Launcher: "stop and resume later" checkpoints + post-team execution plan

- **Stop here and resume later.** After each launcher checkpoint - idea captured,
  PRD added/drafted, team generated, execution plan drafted, build configured -
  the interactive flow asks "Stop here and resume later?" and, when you say yes,
  prints `forge-launcher resume --repo "<path>"` and stops at the "where to pick
  up" summary. Pick the run back up any time with `forge-launcher resume`.
- **Post-team plan & validate step.** After the agent team is generated, the
  launcher now runs project-orchestrator (via `forge-orchestrate-build`, headless)
  with the prompt-playbook 5a prompt to produce the **execution plan** in
  `docs/PROGRESS.md`, commits it (`docs: add execution plan`), and stops for
  review before the build. It selects the monolithic vs. feature-based 5a prompt
  from the repo layout; if the headless run fails or writes no plan, it prints
  the manual `@project-orchestrator` command instead.
- Non-interactive auto-draft (`FORGE_AUTO_DRAFT=1`) runs the plan step
  automatically; stub mode writes a canned `docs/PROGRESS.md` so the flow is
  testable offline.
- Covered by new launcher tests (plan step + checkpoints are interactive-only,
  so non-interactive coverage asserts the plan doc, commit, and engine decision).
  Launcher suite green.

---

## August 2026 - v3.24

### Copilot harness selects the forge agent natively via `/agent`

The copilot adapter previously inlined every agent file into the `copilot -p`
prompt. The Copilot CLI supports an inline `/agent <name>` directive that loads
a repo agent natively - the same idea as opencode's `--agent <name>` (v3.21).

- **Native selection.** When the owning agent's file lives under the project's
  `.github/agents/` directory, the adapter now prepends `/agent <name>` to the
  prompt and lets Copilot load the persona itself; the persona is no longer
  inlined. For other harness roots (`.agents`, `.claude`, `.opencode`) Copilot
  cannot discover the agent files, so the inline-persona fallback is kept.
- **Shared escape hatch.** `FORGE_ENGINE_NATIVE_AGENT=0` forces the inline
  fallback on the copilot harness too (already supported by opencode).
- Covered by a new `harness/copilot-adapter.test.ts` (native, fallback, no-name,
  env-escape, and the execute-now directive). Engine suite green.

- [ADR-030](adr/030-copilot-native-agent-selection.md): copilot `/agent` selection.

---

## August 2026 - v3.23

### Workflow engine output verification gate (no more hollow "complete" runs)

A run could previously report **complete** with no code: every harness adapter
returned `success` on a zero-exit call, and the engine marked the task complete
without checking that anything was produced. A model replying "Ready for the
task." exited 0, the engine synthesized an artifact with `filesChanged: []` for
every task, and the run finished "successfully" with no solution.

- **Expected-output gate.** A task declaring `expectedOutputs` now requires every
  one to exist after the harness call. Missing → the attempt fails, retries, then
  the task is marked `failed` with the missing list.
- **No-op detection.** Tasks declaring no `expectedOutputs` must show evidence of
  work: a git working-tree diff before/after the call (engine-owned `docs/` files
  excluded) or a substantive agent response. "Ready for the task." with no file
  changes is a failed attempt, never a completion.
- **`--allow-noop` / `FORGE_ENGINE_ALLOW_NOOP=1`** relaxes the no-op heuristic
  (the expected-output check stays).
- **`--run-validation` / `FORGE_ENGINE_RUN_VALIDATION=1`** executes each task's
  manifest `validationCommands` (cwd = repo root) and requires them all to pass
  before the task completes. Tasks with validation are gated on it.
- **Hollow-run visibility.** The final summary and `status` flag tasks completed
  with no recorded output files; `forge-launcher resume` does too.
- **Prompt hardening.** Both the opencode and copilot adapters append an explicit
  "perform the task now, then list the files you changed" directive, so agents
  stop merely acknowledging tasks.
- **`FORGE_ENGINE_NATIVE_AGENT=0`** restores the pre-v3.21 opencode behavior
  (inline the persona instead of `--agent <name>`) for `.opencode/` harnesses.
- New `scripts/verify.ts` (gate + git-diff + validation runner) with unit tests;
  engine tests cover the gate, `--allow-noop`, and validation-command failure.
  Engine suite green; `forge-launcher engine-run` passes the new flags through.

- [ADR-029](adr/029-output-verification-gate.md): the engine's output-verification gate.

## August 2026 - v3.22

### Launcher as the single entry point: `forge-launcher resume`, review links, conditional in-harness command

The launcher becomes the one terminal on-ramp, and "when to use what" collapses
to a single mental model: **`forge-launcher` starts you, then you either drive
the build interactively in the harness (`@project-orchestrator`) or hand it to
the autonomous engine (`@workflow-orchestrator` / `forge-launcher engine-run`).**

- **`forge-launcher resume [--repo]`** - re-enters an existing project at its
  current stage (idea → PRD → team → build) as a full interactive wizard. It
  detects what's already drafted, prints where you are with clickable review
  links, and offers the right next action: capture an idea, auto-draft the PRD /
  team headlessly, resume a paused or failed engine run, tail logs, or open the
  harness CLI. `--non-interactive` prints the state plus the exact next commands
  to run. This covers the "walk away to review and make changes, come back
  later" gap in the previous linear 9-step flow.
- **Review links** - the review boundaries (drafted PRD, generated team) and the
  engine summary now emit OSC 8 terminal hyperlinks (Ctrl/Cmd+click to open the
  file), falling back to plain paths on non-TTY output.
- **Conditional in-harness command** - when the launcher opens the CLI (or prints
  next steps) and the agent team already exists, it now queues
  `/forge-orchestrate-build` (project-orchestrator) instead of
  `/forge-auto-build`, honouring "in the harness = project-orchestrator". When
  no team exists yet it keeps queueing `/forge-auto-build` (which generates the
  team in-chat); headless runs keep using `/forge-auto-build` as the terminal
  fast-path.
- **`forge-auto-build` demoted, not removed** - it stays installed but is
  repositioned as the **terminal/headless fast-path** (launcher-driven,
  `opencode run --auto`), explicitly *not* the in-harness entry point. The
  `project-orchestrator` and `workflow-orchestrator` agents now document their
  in-harness roles and the launcher's `engine-run` / `resume` as the canonical
  terminal entry.
- **When to use what:**
  - New project → `forge-launcher` (terminal).
  - In the harness, interactive build → `@project-orchestrator`.
  - Autonomous build → `forge-launcher engine-run` or `@workflow-orchestrator`.
  - Lost your place → `forge-launcher resume`.
  - Authoring only → `/forge-build-prd`, `/forge-auto-build-prd`,
    `/forge-build-agent-team`.
- New tests: `resume.test.ts` (state detection + next-action branches) and
  conditional-queue coverage in `launcher.test.ts`; `format.test.ts` covers the
  OSC 8 `hyperlink` helper. Launcher suite green.

- [ADR-028](adr/028-launcher-entry-resume-and-auto-build-demotion.md): entry-point
  consolidation, `forge-launcher resume`, and the `forge-auto-build` demotion.

---

## August 2026 - v3.21

### OpenCode harness selects the forge agent natively

`opencode run` supports an `--agent <name>` flag, but the workflow engine's
opencode adapter never passed it - every task ran under opencode's **default
agent**, with the forge persona inlined into the prompt. Session lists in
opencode showed default "build" sessions instead of the forge agents
(`discovery-engineer`, `qa-engineer`, …).

- **`--agent` when possible.** When the owning agent's file lives under the
  project's `.opencode/agents/` directory, `OpenCodeAdapter` now passes
  `--agent <name>` and lets opencode load the persona itself. The persona is no
  longer inlined into the prompt, so sessions are attributed to the real forge
  agent and per-task prompts carry no duplicated system text.
- **Graceful fallback.** For other harness roots (`.agents`, `.claude`,
  `.github`) opencode cannot discover the agent files, so the adapter keeps the
  previous inline-persona behavior and passes no `--agent`.
- Covered by new adapter tests (`opencode-adapter.test.ts`) asserting the
  `.opencode` vs non-`.opencode` split and the no-name case.

---

## August 2026 - v3.20

### Generated-team frontmatter quoting guard

Auto-drafted teams could break the build: `forge-build-agent-team` generated
`description:` frontmatter without quotes, and LLM prose routinely contains
`: ` (colon-space), which YAML treats as a nested mapping. `gray-matter` - used
by `forge-execution-adapter compile` to parse every agent/skill file - then
threw, the manifest was never written, and the engine failed with a confusing
"EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json not found".

- **Always-quoted templates.** `forge-build-agent-team`'s agent and skill
  templates now mandate double-quoted `description:` values, with a Gotcha
  explaining the `: ` footgun.
- **Mechanical gate.** A new dependency-free
  `forge-build-agent-team/scripts/validate-frontmatter.mjs` scans the harness
  agents/skills (the same files the adapter parses) and fails deterministically
  on unquoted `: ` values, `#` inside an unquoted value, missing `name` /
  `description`, or unterminated frontmatter. Step 7 of the skill now requires
  it to pass instead of relying on self-report.
- **Clear compile errors.** `forge-execution-adapter` discovery wraps frontmatter
  parsing and rethrows `Invalid YAML frontmatter in <path>: <message> - hint:
  wrap description values in double quotes`, naming the offending file instead
  of a bare js-yaml error.
- **Launcher fail-fast.** `forge-launcher engine-run` aborts immediately when the
  manifest compile exits non-zero (surfacing the compile output) instead of
  continuing to a misleading "manifest not found".
- **Tests.** Adapter suite 17, launcher suite 40, engine suite 25 - all green;
  the validator was exercised against a clean team and a deliberately broken
  fixture.

---

## August 2026 - v3.19

### Headless PRD quality: the gap check now runs automatically

The manual PRD flow runs a dedicated gap check (Step 2b of the prompt playbook):
verify every major component has clear acceptance criteria, a defined tech stack,
non-functional requirements (performance, security, privacy), and implementation
phases - then fill any gaps. Headless/auto-draft PRD runs skipped that pass:

- **Headless PRD gap check.** `forge-auto-build-prd` (headless) now runs the same
  gap check on `docs/PRD.md` after drafting and re-invokes `forge-build-prd` in
  gap-fill mode to fix any gaps, re-verifying before the decomposition check.
  Direct headless `forge-build-prd` invocations do the same before saving. The
  launcher's headless PRD command now spells the check out so the printed
  command documents it.
- **Decomposition and team validation were already covered.** `forge-decompose-prd`
  Step 6 (coverage, valid dependency DAG, no cycles) and `forge-build-agent-team`
  Step 7 (one owner per requirement, no conflicts, naming/frontmatter rules) run
  unconditionally, headless included - no change needed there.
- **Responsibility matrix from the team skill.** `forge-build-agent-team` Step 7
  now writes `docs/agent-responsibility-matrix.md` (ownership by agent, team
  validation summary, phase execution order) matching the execution-adapter's
  deterministic matrix, so headless team generation produces the same durable
  artifact the manual validation prompt and the compile gate do.
- **Tests.** The launcher suite is now **40** `node --test` cases (new: the
  headless PRD message documents the gap check). All packages typecheck clean.

### Forge Board: crisp zoom and in-place expanding cards

- **Crisp text at any zoom.** The dashboard bakes all text at **2× resolution**
  (a shared text-style factory) and bakes the small dot/glow textures at 2×, so
  zooming in no longer upscales soft rasters. Max zoom is clamped to 2× to match
  the bake ceiling.
- **Click a card to expand it in place.** Instead of a side panel, clicking a
  card expands it on the board (floating above its neighbors) with the task's
  detail: description, status, owner, phase, duration, timeout, artifact, error,
  inputs, dependencies, output files, and validation commands. Click the card
  again, the board, or press Escape to collapse it; it animates open/closed and
  stays live as the task's status changes mid-run. The DOM side panel was
  removed.

## August 2026 - v3.18

### Workflow-engine keep-alive attach mode

The opencode harness cold-starts a fresh `opencode run` process for **every
task**, and each one re-boots the project instance: config, AGENTS.md, skills,
agent files, and every MCP server. On multi-task runs that per-task overhead can
rival the actual model work. The engine now attaches tasks to a single warm
`opencode serve` instance instead:

- **`--keep-alive`** (`FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH=1`): the engine boots one headless
  `opencode serve` for the run, waits for `GET /global/health`, attaches every
  task via `opencode run --attach`, and tears the server down when the run
  finishes (even on error). `--keep-alive-port <n>` pins the port; otherwise a
  free port is chosen.
- **`--attach <url>`** (`FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH_URL`): reuse an already-running
  server (e.g. one started by the TUI or a long-lived `opencode serve`) with no
  lifecycle management. `--keep-alive` is ignored (with a warning) for
  non-opencode harnesses.
- **Tasks stay isolated.** Each `opencode run --attach` invocation creates a
  fresh session (no `--continue`/`--session`/`--fork`), so one task's context
  never leaks into the next - the server only keeps the shared project instance
  warm.
- **Server hygiene.** The engine-spawned server is loopback-only and strips any
  ambient `OPENCODE_SERVER_*` auth so the engine's own health probe and attach
  calls aren't 401'd. Attaching to a user-managed authenticated server still
  works (the client auto-sends credentials from the environment).
- **Robust readiness.** `opencode serve` binds its port before it is fully
  booted, so a health request in that window can connect but hang; each probe
  now aborts itself (`AbortSignal.timeout`, 2s) so the readiness loop always
  advances.
- **Measurable win.** `run.ts` reports `bootMs` (ms to first output) and the
  adapter prints `[opencode] task <id>: boot=… total=…` when attaching, so
  per-task durations in `docs/EXECUTION-AUDIT.jsonl` show the cold-boot cost
  dropping to ~0 on tasks 2..N.
- **Launcher passthrough.** `forge-launcher engine-run` accepts
  `--keep-alive`, `--keep-alive-port <n>`, and `--attach <url>` (with
  `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH` / `FORGE_ENGINE_ATTACH_URL` env equivalents), so the
  engine can run warm via the launcher too.
- **Tests.** Engine suite is now **25** `node --test` cases (new: attach-server
  healthy startup + ambient-auth stripping, and the hung-health-attempt abort);
  the launcher suite is now **39** (new: engine-run flag forwarding + env
  defaults, and the auto-draft keep-alive/attach command). All packages
  typecheck clean.

Related architecture decision:

- [ADR-027](adr/027-workflow-engine-keep-alive-attach.md): keep-alive attach
  mode - server lifecycle, session isolation, and auth/health-probe handling.

## August 2026 - v3.17

### Cross-platform `forge-launcher` fixes for Windows

The `forge-launcher` npm package (`1.0.0-beta.2`) is now reliable on Windows,
where the interactive TUI and CLI spawning previously misbehaved:

- **Directory picker that works on Windows.** `@clack/prompts`' `path`
  autocomplete hardcodes `/` and does case-sensitive full-path prefix matching,
  so on Windows the "Parent directory" step listed nothing and typing a name to
  search found nothing. The launcher now uses its own cross-platform picker
  (a clack `select` list over a directory listing): subfolders show immediately,
  `..` goes up (disabled at a drive root), and a "Type a path…" entry accepts
  either `\` or `/` case-insensitively. The readline/Tab-completion fallback
  shares the fix.
- **No more `spawn opencode ENOENT`.** CLIs installed via `npm install -g`
  (opencode, copilot, claude) are `.cmd` shims on Windows, which plain
  `child_process.spawn` cannot launch. Spawning now goes through `cross-spawn`,
  which resolves shims with correct argument quoting. A failed spawn reports
  `Failed to run '<cmd>': … - is it installed and on PATH?` instead of a cryptic
  ENOENT. The terminal auto-launch code also gets correct PATH detection
  (`;`-delimited, `.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat`) and Windows Terminal detection via
  `WT_SESSION`.
- **Friendlier pre-publish install guidance.** The README and
  `docs/forge-launcher.md` document a simple local install
  (`npm install` → `npm pack` → `npm install -g <tarball>`), a dev symlink
  (`npm link`), and the matching uninstall/unlink cleanup - no temp-workspace
  ceremony for day-to-day testing.
- **Update check.** On startup, `forge-launcher` checks the npm registry once a
  day (honoring the configured registry, so a local Verdaccio works) and prints
  a notice when a newer version exists - prereleases check the `beta` tag,
  releases check `latest`. The result is cached in a user-level file, the
  fetch is timeout-bounded and fails silently offline, and it can be disabled
  with `--no-update-check` or `FORGE_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1` (also skipped in CI).

### Cross-platform `forge-workflow-engine` fixes

The workflow engine (the separate package bootstrapped into target repos) had
the same Windows blind spot as the launcher:

- **Engine tasks spawn correctly on Windows.** The engine's per-task harness
  (`opencode`, `copilot`, and flowforge-kernel adapters) now spawns through
  `cross-spawn`, resolving npm-installed `.cmd`/`.bat` shims - so `opencode run`
  tasks no longer fail with `spawn opencode ENOENT` during an engine run.
- **The Forge Board dashboard renders and connects.** The vendored PixiJS v8
  build exposes the `PIXI` global, but `app.js` referenced `Pixi`, so the
  dashboard script aborted with `ReferenceError: Pixi is not defined` before
  opening the SSE connection. `index.html` now normalizes the global
  (`window.Pixi = window.PIXI || window.Pixi`), so the board renders and the
  dashboard connects.
- **Kanban dashboard theme.** The oak-tree-and-squirrel metaphor is gone. The
  build now renders as a **kanban board** - renamed **The Forge Board** - one
  band per phase stacked top-to-bottom (bands **auto-size** so stacked cards
  never overlap the next band), with tasks as cards flowing left-to-right
  through **To Do · In Progress · Done · Failed**. Cards are colored by their
  owning agent (deterministic accent + legend), re-position themselves smoothly
  as their status changes, and dependency/artifact edges connect them
  (brightening on hover) with artifact hand-offs shown as dots. Long titles are
  trimmed to fit the card, context-projection and artifact badges sit on each
  card, and the HUD counts *done / total* tasks. Pan/zoom (from the
  board/background), hover tooltips, and the click detail panel all work as
  before; the fireflies, leaves, and squirrel animations were removed in favor
  of a calm, legible board.
- **Cards are name tags with agent faces.** Each task renders as a **name tag**
  badge: a status-colored header ribbon, an avatar circle holding a
  procedurally-drawn **agent face** (deterministic skin/hair tinted per agent,
  with a mouth that reacts - neutral, working, smiling on complete, frowning on
  failure), the agent's readable name, the task title, and the task id. Agent
  identity is the ring/border color, so the legend and the cards agree at a
  glance.
- **In Progress is live, not stale.** The engine now **persists a task's
  `running` status when it starts**, so snapshots and dashboard reconnects show
  in-flight work instead of a stale "pending" (previously the state was only
  saved after a task finished). A crash that leaves a task "running" is
  recovered on restart: `runEngine` resets such tasks to `pending` so they run
  instead of deadlocking.
- **Tests.** The engine suite is now **23** `node --test` cases (kanban layout
  replaces the whorl-tree layout, squirrel-name module removed, plus a crash-
  recovery regression test); the launcher suite remains at **36**.

Related architecture decisions:

- [ADR-026](adr/026-forge-board-kanban-dashboard.md): the Forge Board - kanban
  redesign, name-tag cards with agent faces, and the running-status
  persistence/crash-recovery behavior.

  Forge oak-tree visualization (superseded by ADR-026).

### Live visualization: The Squirrel Forge

Watching "dark orchestration" used to mean tailing
`docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json` or the audit log. The workflow engine now ships a
live, localhost **PixiJS dashboard** that renders the build as a single oak
tree which **grows over the course of the run**:

- **`--viz` on `workflow-engine run`.** Starts a dependency-free `node:http`
  server before the main loop, broadcasts every audit event in-process over
  **SSE** (a single hook inside `writeAuditEvent` - no engine rework), auto-opens
  the browser at `http://127.0.0.1:4299` (next free port if busy), and shuts
  down shortly after the run so the finale renders. Pass `--no-open` to skip
  auto-opening.
- **The scene.** Phases are whorls up the trunk; tasks hang from each whorl's
  branch line. Every agent is a **named squirrel** (deterministic names -
  `api-engineer` → Tailor, `qa-engineer` → Nutsy - with a seeded hash fallback
  for arbitrary agents) whose pose maps to status: dozing = pending, scurrying =
  running, celebration bounce = complete, tumble = failed, faded = skipped. On
  `artifact.created` an **acorn rolls up the trunk** to the consuming squirrel,
  and `context.projected` shows a knapsack-arc gauge of token reduction on a
  busy squirrel. The canopy fills with leaves as tasks complete, browns on
  failure, and blooms when all squirrels gather and hoist a golden acorn at the
  end.
- **Interactions.** Hover for a tooltip, click a squirrel for the task panel
  (title, owner, status, duration, output files, artifact), drag to pan, scroll
  to zoom. A snapshot replays on every (re)connect.
- **`workflow-engine viz` attach mode.** Tails `docs/EXECUTION-AUDIT.jsonl` and
  serves the same dashboard, so you can watch an **already-running or detached**
  engine run (e.g. the `forge-auto-build` path) from any terminal.
- **Launcher pass-through.** `forge-launcher engine-run --viz` (and
  `--viz-port <n>` / `--no-open`) forwards to the engine; `FORGE_ENGINE_VIZ=1`
  and `FORGE_ENGINE_VIZ_PORT` set the same defaults.
- **Zero new runtime dependencies.** PixiJS v8 is vendored
  (`viz/dashboard/vendor/pixi.min.js`, ~0.8 MB); events stream over SSE via
  `node:http`; no WebSocket or npm dependency was added to the engine.
- **Tests.** The engine suite grew to **26** `node --test` cases (new:
  whorl-tree layout, deterministic squirrel naming, and the viz server's
  manifest/state/layout endpoints, SSE snapshot + in-process broadcast, tail
  source, `done`-on-shutdown, and port binding). Launcher suite stays at 16.
  All packages typecheck clean.

### Live dashboard: TUI toggle, detached-run logging, and connection feedback

- **Viz option in the engine decision.** The launcher's engine configuration
  now asks whether to **launch the live Squirrel Forge dashboard** during the
  run (default on, optional port), and the detached run / printed command carry
  `--viz` / `--viz-port` (`FORGE_ENGINE_VIZ`, `FORGE_ENGINE_VIZ_PORT`).
- **Detached runs are actually observable.** `spawnDetached` now tees the
  detached child's stdout+stderr into `docs/engine-run.log` even when only a
  log file is configured (previously the streams went to `/dev/null`, so a
  silent failure looked like "it never started"). A no-PRD warning appears
  before starting detached, since the engine can't compile a manifest without
  one. The dashboard starts once the engine starts (after manifest prep) and
  its URL is printed to the log.
- **The dashboard can't look "unconnected" anymore.** The HUD status line is
  now driven by the live connection: `connected · run <id> · <status>` on
  snapshot/state, "connection lost · retrying…" / "disconnected" via an
  `onerror` handler, and "run finished" on shutdown. Render errors are caught
  and surfaced instead of silently killing the event handlers, and the scene
  rebuilds cleanly on reconnect. The engine also starts the dashboard before
  the pre-run gate so the URL is available while you review the summary.

  visualization - design, event streaming, the two launch modes, and the
  zero-dependency PixiJS vendoring.

### Feature-based manifest compilation, team validation, and the responsibility matrix

The workflow-engine path previously compiled `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json`
**only** from the monolithic `docs/PRD.md`, ignoring the decomposed layout and
skipping the team-validation / responsibility-matrix steps that the
prompt-driven path (`forge-orchestrate-build` + `forge-build-agent-team`)
performs. It now matches the original flow:

- **Feature-based compile mode (auto-detected).** When
  `docs/product-vision.md` + `docs/features/*.md` exist, the adapter reads the
  vision's `## 14. Features` dependency table, orders features topologically
  (dependencies first; cycles or a missing table fall back to document order
  with a warning), and compiles each feature's `## 5. Implementation Tasks` /
  `### Phase N:` blocks into manifest phases. Phase ids are feature-tagged
  (e.g. `BUDGETS-2`) so task ids stay globally unique across features. The
  manifest records `sourceLayout: "features"` and `featureOrder`. Features with
  no phase headings get a single phase synthesized from their Functional
  Requirements bullets (warned). Monolithic repos compile exactly as before.
- **Team-validation gate (always at compile).** Every `compile` checks for
  unassigned tasks, output files owned by more than one agent, and orphan
  agents (generated agents that own no task) - mirroring
  `forge-build-agent-team` Step 7 - surfacing any findings as manifest warnings.
- **Responsibility matrix restored.** `compile` writes
  `docs/agent-responsibility-matrix.md` (validation results + an
  agent × phase × task × outputs table + phase execution order) and records its
  path on the manifest (`responsibilityMatrixPath`). The workflow engine's
  pre-run summary prints the source layout, feature order, and matrix path.
- **TUI engine configuration.** Choosing *run the build now (detached)* or
  *print the engine command* in the launcher now opens an engine-configuration
  step (defaults preselected, Esc keeps them): per-task harness, task
  granularity, parallel-agent count, per-task timeout, and max retries. The
  `engine-run` command gained `--granularity`, `--max-retries`,
  `--retry-delay-ms`, and `--heartbeat-ms` (with `FORGE_ENGINE_GRANULARITY`,
  `FORGE_ENGINE_MAX_RETRIES`, `FORGE_ENGINE_RETRY_DELAY_MS`,
  `FORGE_ENGINE_HEARTBEAT_MS` env equivalents). Setting `--granularity`
  recompiles the manifest at that granularity even when one already exists, with
  a note to clear `docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json` if a previous run is in progress.
- **Tests.** Launcher suite is now 16 `node --test` cases (including the
  engine-config command regression); the execution adapter covers the
  feature-based compile, ordering, feature-tagged ids, team validation, and
  responsibility matrix at 17 cases. All packages typecheck clean.

  and the generated responsibility matrix.

## August 2026 - v3.14

### Forge launcher as a Node npm package with a TUI

The CLI layer (`forge-launcher`, `bootstrap`, `forge-engine-run`) is now a
single cross-platform **`forge-launcher` npm package** at
`scripts/forge-launcher/`, replacing the six dual bash/PowerShell scripts
(which remain as thin delegating wrappers during the transition, then are
removed).

- **One codebase, three subcommands.** `forge-launcher` (9-step onboarding),
  `forge-launcher bootstrap`, and `forge-launcher engine-run` mirror the legacy
  entry points with an unchanged flags/env-var contract. Run it from anywhere
  with `npx forge-launcher` - no forge clone needed (templates are bundled as
  resources).
- **Interactive TUI.** All prompts use `@clack/prompts` - `select` menus
  (harness, PRD, engine decision), `confirm`, `text`, `multiline` (Enter-twice
  submits), and an autocomplete path picker - with a readline fallback for
  piped/CI input and a clean Ctrl+C exit (code 130).
- **Spinners instead of heartbeats.** Long-running steps (repo create,
  bootstrap, push, headless skill runs) show a clack spinner with their output
  tee'd to a per-run log (`/tmp/forge-launcher-<pid>.log`), printed on failure.
  The old "still running… Ns" heartbeat and the bash/PSReadLine Tab-completion
  hacks are gone.
- **Drift fixed.** The "Launch CLI now?" prompts default to `no` everywhere
  (the PowerShell variant had drifted to `yes`).
- **Auto-draft reliability.** Headless skill runs now set `FORGE_HEADLESS=1`
  for the spawned harness CLI so the forge skills' headless gate fires
  deterministically, and pass `--dir "<repo>"` to `opencode run` so the skill
  runs in the **target repository** - `opencode run` resolves its project
  directory from its parent process, not the child's spawn `cwd`, so without
  `--dir` the skill ran in the launcher's own directory and reported its input
  (`docs/IDEA.md`) as missing. The workflow-engine `opencode` adapter passes the
  same `--dir` for the same reason. If an auto-draft stage finishes without its
  artifact, the launcher prints the run-log tail, `git status`, and whether the
  skill file resolved, then offers to run the skill manually. `--debug` /
  `FORGE_LAUNCHER_DEBUG=1` always shows the log tail, and
  `FORGE_RUN_WITH=stub` (with `FORGE_STUB_NOOP=1`) runs the auto-draft stages
  offline against canned artifacts for testing.
- **Detached engine start fixed.** Choosing "Run the workflow-engine build now
  (detached)" re-invoked the CLI via `new URL("./cli.ts")`, which resolves to
  `dist/cli.ts` - a file that does not exist when running the compiled package -
  so the detached child failed to start with ENOENT and no manifest or
  `docs/engine-run.log` ever appeared. The entry now resolves to `dist/cli.js`
  when compiled (and preloads the tsx loader when running from source), and
  `spawnDetached` writes a "failed to start" line to the log if the spawn fails
  instead of failing silently.
- **Tests.** 15 `node --test` cases (bootstrap harness mapping/rewrite/
  gitignore, path expansion, non-interactive E2E layout + queued-command
  selection, the `--dir` pinning of headless skill commands, detached engine
  command resolution, and stub-runner coverage of the auto-draft success and
  failure paths). `scripts/test-forge-launcher.sh` now delegates to the package
  suite. Interactive TUI verified end-to-end under a pty.

  package (supersedes ADR-010's script-first/no-dependency decision).

## August 2026 - v3.13

### Finer-grained tasks and a configurable task timeout

Workflow-engine tasks were failing because each harness adapter hardcoded a
per-task timeout (`10 * 60 * 1000`ms); when a task exceeded it, the child was
killed and the task failed after retries. Task granularity was also locked to
one PRD bullet per task, so a large bullet became one long, opaque task. Two
changes fix this.

- **Fine-grained task decomposition (now the default).** `forge-execution-adapter
  compile` expands indented sub-bullets into their own chained tasks and splits
  oversized (multi-sentence) bullets at sentence boundaries. Every task keeps
  owner matching, the linear dependency chain, and artifact `inputs`/`produces`
  wiring. Split tasks are reported as compile warnings. `--granularity coarse`
  reproduces the legacy one-bullet-per-task output exactly, and the manifest
  records `granularity: "coarse" | "fine"`.
- **Configurable per-task timeout.** `--task-timeout-ms <ms>` (or
  `FORGE_ENGINE_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS`) sets the engine-wide budget (default 10 min,
  unchanged). A task's own `timeoutMs` field in the manifest overrides it. The
  `opencode`, `copilot`, and `flowforge-kernel` adapters use the effective
  timeout instead of a hardcoded constant; the `openai` adapter now enforces it
  with an `AbortController` (previously unbounded). The pre-run summary prints
  the effective timeout, and `scripts/forge-engine-run.sh` / `.ps1` pass
  `--task-timeout-ms` / `-TaskTimeoutMs` through.
- **Tests.** Coverage for sub-bullet expansion, long-bullet splitting, `coarse`
  regression equivalence, timeout precedence (per-task beats global), and
  `runCommand` enforcing a custom timeout.

Related architecture decision:

  task decomposition and the configurable task timeout.

## August 2026 - v3.12

### Parallel task dispatch in the workflow engine

The engine previously drained its ready-task frontier **sequentially** (a
documented MVP tradeoff, ADR-014). It now executes that frontier in bounded
**waves**, cutting wall-clock time on multi-agent builds from sum-of-durations to
the critical path.

- **Wave-based dispatch.** Each wave computes `nextReadyTasks` (unchanged), runs
  the ready set through a bounded worker pool, and merges the terminal
  transitions back into state in **manifest order** (deterministic regardless of
  completion order). State is saved once per wave; newly-unblocked tasks are
  picked up on the next wave.
- **Opt-in concurrency.** `--concurrency <n>` (or `FORGE_ENGINE_CONCURRENCY`)
  caps how many ready tasks run in parallel. Default `1` reproduces the previous
  sequential behavior exactly. `<= 1` is treated as sequential.
- **Per-harness safety valve.** `HarnessAdapter` gains a
  `supportsConcurrency` capability flag; the engine only parallelizes harnesses
  that opt in. All current adapters do (`openai`, `stub`, `opencode`, `copilot`,
  `flowforge-kernel`). Repo-editing harnesses still rely on the manifest
  dependency graph for file isolation.
- **`flowforge-kernel` de-synchronized.** Converted from blocking `execFileSync`
  to async `runCommand` (unblocks the event loop, fixes the streaming gap, and
  promise-caches the `validatePackage` preflight).
- **Race-safe artifacts.** `ArtifactStore` ID allocation moved to an in-memory
  reservation counter (seeded from disk), eliminating duplicate artifact IDs
  under concurrency.
- **Drain-on-failure.** In-flight tasks in a wave run to completion; failed
  tasks' dependents never enter a later wave, and the run is marked `failed`
  exactly as before.
- **Runner passthrough.** `scripts/forge-engine-run.sh` / `.ps1` accept
  `--concurrency <n>` / `-Concurrency <n>` (and `FORGE_ENGINE_CONCURRENCY`), so
  the standalone/launcher engine path can opt into parallelism.
- **Bootstrap never ships `node_modules`.** The engine `node_modules` directories
  were accidentally committed to the forge repo and copied into every
  bootstrapped target by `cp -r` (~88MB each). They are now untracked (ignored),
  and `bootstrap.sh` / `bootstrap.ps1` exclude `node_modules/` and `dist/` when
  copying skill templates - the target repo installs engine dependencies on
  demand via `npm install` at engine-prep time. Only `package.json` /
  `package-lock.json` / `scripts/` / `SKILL.md` / `tsconfig.json` ship.

Related architecture decision:

- [ADR-021](adr/021-parallel-task-dispatch.md): wave-based parallel dispatch,
  `supportsConcurrency`, `flowforge-kernel` async conversion, and race-safe
  artifact IDs.

---

## August 2026 - v3.11

### Workflow-engine heartbeat, OpenCode adapter fix, and clearer engine handoff

- **OpenCode adapter no longer passes `--system-prompt`.** `opencode run` (v1.18+)
  has no such flag, so the previous invocation printed the CLI usage and failed
  every task. The agent persona (`agent.rawBody`) is now inlined into the prompt,
  matching the copilot and openai adapters. Docs (SKILL.md, deep-dive) updated.
- **Shell-safe child invocation.** The `opencode` and `copilot` adapters now use
  asynchronous `spawn` (via a shared `harness/run.ts`) instead of `spawnSync`
  with a shell string. This fixes `/bin/sh` interpolation errors from backticks
  and `$` in agent bodies, and keeps the event loop free for the heartbeat.
- **Engine heartbeat.** While a task is executing, the engine prints
  `…still working on task <id> (@<agent>, Ns elapsed)` every
  `--heartbeat-ms <ms>` (default 15s; `0` disables, `FORGE_ENGINE_HEARTBEAT_MS`
  env override) so a quiet terminal doesn't look hung.
- **`--yes` actually skips the pre-run gate.** The boolean flag was parsed with a
  value-expecting helper, so it never matched; added a proper `hasFlag` check
  (alongside `FORGE_ENGINE_YES=1`).
- **Clearer engine handoff in the launcher.** Choosing "Run the workflow-engine
  build now (detached)" now sets an engine-started flag, skips the subsequent
  interactive CLI launch prompt, prints `tail -f` / `Get-Content -Wait` monitor
  commands, and makes the Step 9 summary reflect the running engine instead of
  the manual `@workspace /forge-auto-build` steps. Fixed the `Skip -I will…`
  menu typo. (Bash + PowerShell.)
- **Artifact store on by default.** `forge-execution-adapter compile` now
  auto-declares `produces` (and wires `inputs` to the previous task) for every
  task it emits, so `docs/artifacts/` is populated on every successful run
  without hand-editing the manifest. Semantic types are still available as a
  manual override.
- **New user guide.** Added `docs/workflow-engine.md`, a `forge-launcher.md`-style
  reference for running, resuming, and troubleshooting the workflow engine.
- **Skipped tasks no longer deadlock.** The DAG readiness checks now treat a
  `skipped` task as done (matching `isComplete`), so a skipped task no longer
  blocks the next phase and aborts the run with "Dependency deadlock detected".
- **Every compiled task has an owner.** `forge-execution-adapter compile` now
  falls back to an `*orchestrator`-named agent (else the first agent) when no
  agent confidently matches a task, instead of leaving it `unassigned`.
- **Engine unit tests.** Added `forge-workflow-engine/scripts/engine.test.ts`
  (`node:test`) covering the DAG readiness, deadlock, and completion logic.

## August 2026 - v3.10

### Forge launcher: auto-draft flow and friendlier path input

The launcher's interactive and headless paths get three quality-of-life upgrades
for getting from an idea to a reviewable PRD/team to an engine run.

- **Path prompts support Tab completion and shell shorthand.** Parent-directory,
  PRD, and research/seed path prompts now use bash readline (`read -e`) on Bash
  and PSReadLine (`PSConsoleReadLine::ReadLine`) on PowerShell for **Tab
  completion** to existing files/folders. Typed paths also expand `~`, `~/`,
  `~user`, and `$VAR` / `${VAR}` (e.g. `$HOME/docs/prd.md`) before validation -
  so external PRD/seed locations work without typing full absolute paths.
  Validation now normalises paths (`realpath -m`) and reports *"file not found"*
  vs. *"not a regular file"* distinctly.
- **Optional auto-draft flow.** At Step 8, the launcher can run the authoring
  stages non-interactively with **review boundaries**:
  - **Idea → PRD:** runs `forge-auto-build-prd` headless (auto-proceed, every
    unknown recorded as an Open Question), commits `docs: add auto-drafted PRD`,
    then points you at the result (monolithic or decomposed) for review.
  - **PRD → team:** runs `forge-build-agent-team` headless, commits
    `feat: generate auto-drafted agent team`, then points you at the generated
    agents/skills for review. When a decomposed layout exists, the team is built
    from `docs/product-vision.md` + `docs/features/*.md` (Vision + Features
    mode); otherwise from `docs/PRD.md`.
  - **Engine decision:** after the team, choose to run the workflow engine now
    (detached via `forge-engine-run.sh --repo <repo> --harness <h> --yes`), print
    the command to run later, or skip and build manually.
  - Exposed as interactive prompts, pre-answered with `--draft` (`-Draft` on
    PowerShell), or forced headlessly with `FORGE_AUTO_DRAFT=1`.
- **Generalised headless runner.** The queued-skill headless path and the
  auto-draft stages share `headless_cmd_for` / `run_skill_headless` (Bash) and
  `Get-HeadlessCommandFor` / `Invoke-SkillHeadless` (PowerShell), so `--headless`,
  `--draft`, and `FORGE_AUTO_DRAFT=1` all print the same `opencode run --auto` /
  `copilot -p --yolo` command shape under `--dry-run`.
- **"Still running" indicator.** Long-running steps (bootstrap, headless/auto-draft
  skill runs, GitHub repo creation, push) show a periodic `still running… Ns`
  heartbeat (Bash: `run_with_heartbeat`, TTY-only and zombie-safe; PowerShell:
  indeterminate `Write-Progress`) so users don't think the launcher is hung.
  Output stays visible, and the interval is configurable via
  `FORGE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (default `15`s). Skipped for piped/CI output.

## August 2026 - v3.9

### Authoring/execution split, detached engine, and GitHub Copilot harness

The workflow engine no longer runs *inside* the CLI session. Authoring (PRD → team → manifest) stays in the chat; **execution runs detached**, as a standalone process that outlives the terminal and resumes with `run`.

- **Detached engine handoff.** `forge-auto-build`'s engine path (`GO --workflow-engine`) now compiles the manifest, starts the engine with `nohup … >> docs/engine-run.log 2>&1 &`, and polls `docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json` to completion instead of blocking the session. The build survives the chat and never dies with it.
- **Standalone runner.** New `scripts/forge-engine-run.sh` / `forge-engine-run.ps1` run the engine from outside any CLI (second terminal, CI, or `nohup`): install deps, compile the manifest if missing, then `npm run workflow-engine -- run --harness <h> --yes`. `--dry-run` prints the sequence.
- **GitHub Copilot per-task harness.** New `--harness copilot` adapter invokes `copilot -p "<agent context + task prompt>" --yolo` per task (agent contents inlined -`copilot -p` has no `--system-prompt` flag). Env vars: `COPILOT_BIN`, `COPILOT_EXTRA_FLAGS`. Per-task harness selected with `FORGE_ENGINE_HARNESS` (default `opencode`).
- **Engine dependencies are explicit and never committed.** `bootstrap.sh` / `bootstrap.ps1` ensure the target repo's `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/` and `docs/engine-run.log`; `forge-auto-build`'s final commit skips `**/node_modules/**`. Docs state the engine needs `node >= 18` + npm at build time.

## August 2026 - v3.8

### Automatic PRD quality gates and PRD-prerequisite build execution

Implements CR-001. Two principles: automate deterministic mechanical gates, preserve deliberate human gates.

- **PRD decomposition is automatic.** `forge-build-prd` gains a Step 5 that evaluates the existing criteria (15+ functional requirements or 3+ implementation phases) immediately after the user confirms the PRD. A qualifying PRD automatically invokes `forge-decompose-prd` -no opt-in question. A non-qualifying PRD stays monolithic and the outcome is reported. `forge-decompose-prd` remains independently invokable.
- **`forge-build-prd` absorbs the PRD review checklist.** The review gate from the retired `forge-bootstrap-project` (Scope & intent, Requirements, Technical choices, Plan, Open items) is now part of `forge-build-prd` Step 4.
- **`forge-bootstrap-project` is retired** and its skill directory removed. Its idea-confirmation pattern is reused by the new `forge-auto-build-prd` skill; its PRD review checklist is reused by `forge-build-prd`.
- **New `forge-auto-build-prd` skill.** A meta-skill that confirms an idea, invokes `forge-build-prd` (review + automatic decomposition), verifies the outputs, and stops before team generation - the PRD-creation fast path.
- **`forge-auto-build` requires an existing PRD.** It no longer generates a PRD or interviews for a one-line idea. Its pre-flight check requires `docs/PRD.md` or the decomposed `docs/product-vision.md` + `docs/features/*.md`; if neither exists it stops and directs the user to `forge-auto-build-prd` / `forge-build-prd`. Stages are reduced to team generation → optional model assignment → build execution (`forge-orchestrate-build` or `--workflow-engine`).
- **Launcher handoff updated.** `forge-launcher` (Bash + PowerShell) queues `forge-auto-build` when a PRD was captured in Step 6, or `forge-auto-build-prd` when it was not, so the build pipeline (agent team + build execution, including the workflow-engine path) runs once the PRD exists.
- **`detect-harness.md` relocated** from `forge-bootstrap-project/references/` to `forge-build-agent-team/references/`; all referencing skills updated.

Related architecture decision:

- [ADR-018](adr/018-auto-prd-decomposition-and-build-prerequisite.md): automatic decomposition gate, `forge-bootstrap-project` retirement, and the PRD-prerequisite build pipeline.

## August 2026 - v3.7

### Artifact Store and Context Projection in `forge-workflow-engine`

- Added a file-based **artifact store** (`templates/skills/forge-workflow-engine/scripts/artifacts.ts`) that persists every meaningful agent output as a compact, typed JSON artifact under `docs/artifacts/<type-prefix>/<artifact-id>.json`.
- Artifacts are organised into three categories: **decision** (what we are building and why), **work** (what has been done), and **evidence** (how we know it is correct).
- Added **context projection**: before each task is dispatched, the engine resolves the task's declared `inputs`, fetches the relevant artifacts from the store, and builds a minimal markdown `contextBlock` that replaces the full workflow state in the agent prompt - dramatically reducing per-task token consumption.
- Extended `ManifestTask` with two optional fields (`inputs` and `produces`) so workflows can declare the artifact hand-off contract directly in `EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json`.
- Extended the `HarnessAdapter` interface with an optional `contextBlock` parameter; `OpenCodeAdapter` and `OpenAIAdapter` both prepend it when present. Existing adapters that ignore it remain unchanged.
- Added two new audit event actions: `artifact.created` and `context.projected` (with `sourceTokenEstimate`, `projectedTokenEstimate`, and `reductionPercent` fields).
- Added [`docs/artifact-store-deep-dive.md`](artifact-store-deep-dive.md): full walkthrough of the pattern, artifact schema, the three-category taxonomy, projection mechanics, and extension points.

## August 2026 - v3.6

### Workforce compiler + optional FlowForge kernel handoff

- Added `forge-workforce-compiler` (`templates/skills/forge-workforce-compiler/`): portable TypeScript tooling that compiles Forge artifacts into `dist/<package-id>.workforce`, writes FlowForge-style `workforce.json` + workflow files, and emits `docs/KERNEL-BRIDGE.json` for task/node mapping and state/audit bridge metadata.
- Added a FlowForge-compatible schema gate to the compiler (`validate` command and post-compile fail-fast validation).
- Added optional `flowforge-kernel` harness mode to `forge-workflow-engine` so Stage 4 execution can hand off to FlowForge CLI/runtime while preserving existing `opencode`, `openai`, and `stub` modes.
- Added [`docs/workforce-compiler-deep-dive.md`](workforce-compiler-deep-dive.md): deep technical walkthrough of compiler packaging, validation gate, and kernel handoff integration.
- Expanded [`docs/testing-guide.md`](testing-guide.md) with a dedicated manual test path for workforce compilation and FlowForge kernel handoff.
- Updated docs and prompt playbook with the new compile + kernel execution path.

Related architecture decision:

- [ADR-016](adr/016-forge-workforce-compiler-and-kernel-handoff.md): Forge-as-authoring + kernel-as-execution boundary, interop contract v1, and state/audit bridge policy.

## August 2026 - v3.5

### Dynamic Workflow Orchestration via `forge-workflow-engine`

- `forge-workflow-engine` (`templates/skills/forge-workflow-engine/`): runtime layer that reads `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json`, builds a live task DAG, dispatches agent invocations through a pluggable harness adapter, retries failed tasks, and syncs `docs/PROGRESS.md` and `docs/EXECUTION-AUDIT.jsonl` after every state transition.
- `workflow-orchestrator` (`templates/agents/workflow-orchestrator.md`): human-facing companion agent that handles pre-run verification, CLI invocation, blocker escalation, and post-run summaries.
- Three harness adapters ship in MVP: `OpenCodeAdapter` (shells out to `opencode run`), `OpenAIAdapter` (direct API), and `StubAdapter` (synthetic results for testing).
- Machine-readable run state is stored in `docs/WORKFLOW-STATE.json`; `docs/PROGRESS.md` stays in sync so existing `project-orchestrator`-style resume flows remain compatible.
- CLI supports `run`, `status`, `replay`, and `pause` operations.
- `forge-auto-build` now supports either/or build execution: the default Stage 4 path uses `forge-orchestrate-build`, while `GO --workflow-engine` switches Stage 4 to manifest compilation plus autonomous execution with `workflow-engine run --harness opencode`.
- Auto-deployed by bootstrap scripts; no bootstrap changes required.

Related architecture decision:

- [ADR-014](adr/014-dynamic-workflow-orchestration.md): engine architecture, harness adapter interface, DAG ordering, retry policy, and integration with `forge-auto-build`.

### Manual Testing Guide

- [`docs/testing-guide.md`](testing-guide.md): step-by-step manual verification guide covering (1) skill creation from the team builder - confirming `skill-creator` and `skill-review` are invoked and the quality gate is enforced - and (2) workflow engine dark orchestration - verifying manifest compilation, the pre-run gate, autonomous task dispatch, state sync, resume, retry, and replay. Includes a plain-language explanation of "dark orchestration" (background/autonomous execution, not anything security-related) and a troubleshooting section.

### Auto-build input auto-detection and launcher handoff alignment

- `forge-auto-build` Step 0 now supports resolving input from repository context when invoked without an explicit argument.
- Input resolution flow now prioritizes explicit user input, then checks `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/IDEA.md`, and `IDEA.md`.
- If multiple candidate sources are present, the skill asks the user to choose one source for that run.
- Launcher handoff guidance now points to `docs/IDEA.md` as the canonical source.

## August 2026 - v3.3

### Forge Execution Adapter - contract-driven bridge for external runners

- `forge-execution-adapter` (`templates/skills/forge-execution-adapter/`): portable TypeScript tooling that discovers a Forge repo, normalizes harness roots, compiles `docs/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.json`, synchronizes `docs/PROGRESS.md`, and appends `docs/EXECUTION-AUDIT.jsonl` for FlowForge-style backends.

Related architecture decision:

## August 2026 - v3.2

### Forge Launcher - interactive CLI for the full lifecycle

- `forge-launcher` (`scripts/forge-launcher.sh` and `scripts/forge-launcher.ps1`): one terminal command guides users from zero to auto-build by creating a repo, selecting a harness, bootstrapping MyForge, capturing project idea context, committing, and optionally spawning the harness CLI.
- Terminal launch hardening and fallback guidance for CLI harnesses.
- PRD-first guidance and seed-document recommendations added to launcher flow docs.

## August 2026 - v3.1

### Full auto build, end-to-end pipeline in one command

- `forge-auto-build` meta-skill: one command from one-liner idea (or existing PRD) to fully built, validated, and committed project.
- Single pre-flight gate followed by autonomous execution: PRD -> agent team -> optional model assignment -> all build phases, with validation and commits after each phase.

## August 2026 - v3.0

### Skill-Forge integration and framework-agnostic skill creation

- Added three integrated skills from skill-forge: `skill-creator`, `skill-review`, and `skill-review-updater`.
- `forge-build-agent-team` now invokes `skill-creator` for project-specific skill generation and validation.
- `skill-review` includes portable TypeScript tooling and CI providers (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps).
- Removed `forge-build-agent-framework-solution` to keep the forge framework-agnostic.
